# About
This project was created in LabView 2018 (32bit) to synchronizes Thorlabs DC2100 light signal with video (or image sequence) tracking. It allows you to automate a large number of similar experiments and record files for subsequent processing of animal behavior by various programs. The project is used in the article: Workflow for the rat anxiety behavior modulation using optogenetic inhibition  of the  dorsal raphe neurons.

# Requirements
This project uses third party libraries such as DC2100.llb and IMAQ Vision libraries.
